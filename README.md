# Create React App Ejected

This repo tracks the ejected state of each [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (CRA) release for those who have ejected but would like to maintain upstream compatibility.

## Usage

Each commit (except the initial) is a snapshot of CRA right after ejection. The commit message matches the release version number of CRA used for the ejection. To view changes between releases, simply compare the commits.
